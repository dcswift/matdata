Damian Swift, frozen-ion cold curves, Jan 2011

LDA, various Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials:
- Na_00.cerpot: gs energy converged v slowly with Ecut
- Na_01.cerpot: gs energy converged quite fast, but cold curve seemed v soft
- na2001new.11: gs energy converged fast; cold curve v similar to Na_01
